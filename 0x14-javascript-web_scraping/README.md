# 0x14. JavaScript - Web scraping

` Scripting ` ` API `  ` JavaScript `

In this Project I continued to practice my Javascript and got comfortable working with JSON format. I also learned how to use ` requests ` and ` fetch ` APIs.

## Tasks 

### 0. Readme

I wrote a simple script that prints the content of a file
usage ` ./0-readme <filename> `

### 1. Write me

I wrote a script that writes a given content to a file
Usage: ` ./1-writeme <file_path> <content> `
the script relies on a call back function to notify the user if an error was encountered.

Usage: ` ./2-statuscode.js  <URL> `
